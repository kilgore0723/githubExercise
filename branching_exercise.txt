1. git branch "branch name"
2. A fast-forward merge in Git is a simple merge that moves the branch pointer forward,
while a recursive merge uses the merge algorithm to combine the changes from the two branches.
3. git checkout "branch name"
4. git branch -d "branch name"
5. Merge conflicts happen when the same lines in a file have been modified in different ways on two branches 
that are being merged. Git is unable to automatically resolve the conflict and requires the user to manually 
resolve the conflict by deciding which changes to keep and which to discard.
